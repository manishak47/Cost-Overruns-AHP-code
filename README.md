This custom Python script code computes the priority vector using both aggregation methods at the priority level and the matrix level, with calculations performed via the Arithmetic Mean and Geometric Mean approaches. 
These dual approaches of calculating priority vectors enhance the reliability of the results, capturing detail preferences expressed by the participants. 
This tool systematically computes priority vectors through two aggregation methodologies: 
i.	Priority-level aggregation: It averages the individual respondent priority vectors directly (again, using both arithmetic and geometric means) post-calculation of eigenvectors. 
ii.	Matrix-level aggregation: It averages the raw matrices (both arithmetic and geometric means) and then calculates the priority vector. This aggregation is averaging before computing priorities resulting in better capture of the overall judgment structure.
The excel files are the input matrix files for analysis and the structure of the AHP is shown in the Figure 5 of the file "Ranking of factors using AHP.docx"
